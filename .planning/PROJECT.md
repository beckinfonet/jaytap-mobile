# JayTap

## What This Is

JayTap is a mobile real-estate app for Bishkek where users rent, sell, and browse properties — with curated 3D Matterport tours and panoramic imagery as a differentiator for hostels, hotels, and premium listings. Built as a React Native 0.84 app (iOS + Android) with a Railway-hosted backend and Firebase Identity Toolkit for auth, serving landlords, sellers, hospitality owners, and prospective renters/buyers.

## Core Value

Prospective renters and buyers can reliably browse, filter, and inquire about Bishkek properties on a phone without UI blockers (keyboard covering inputs, navigation getting stuck, forms requesting wrong fields for the property type).

## Requirements

### Validated

<!-- Shipped in production prior to this GSD init — inferred from codebase map (.planning/codebase/). -->

- ✓ Email/password signup, login, logout — existing (`AuthService`, `AuthContext`, Firebase Identity Toolkit)
- ✓ Password reset flow (forgot + reset screens) — shipped in v1.0.21
- ✓ Password policy (min 7 chars, uppercase, number, symbol) — shipped in v1.0.22
- ✓ Cached user session via AsyncStorage — existing
- ✓ Account settings + account deletion — existing
- ✓ Property browsing (Home screen with list + filters) — existing
- ✓ Property details screen with verification trust signals — existing
- ✓ Create / edit listing form (9 property types, Rent/Sell toggle) — existing
- ✓ Owner / renter listing views — existing
- ✓ Favorites — existing
- ✓ Chat (compose + thread) — existing
- ✓ Schedule viewing + appointments — existing
- ✓ 3D tour viewer (Matterport via WebView) + tour selection — existing
- ✓ Dark/light theme following system preference — existing
- ✓ English/Russian localization — existing (`@jaytap_language` AsyncStorage key)
- ✓ Admin-only verification flag editing (`user.backendProfile.userType === 'admin'`) — partial, one screen only

### Active

<!-- Milestone 1 — v1.0.4 "Polish + Hospitality". Ship ASAP to stores. -->

**Bug-fix workstream:**
- [ ] Keyboard no longer covers inputs on any screen (iOS + Android, universal solution)
- [ ] Bottom nav responds from any screen (Chat, Profile, Favorites, etc.) — reproduce → root-cause → fix
- [ ] Alignment issues addressed across app (specific screens to be provided via screenshots)

**Listing form overhaul:**
- [ ] `Land` property type removed everywhere (chips, filters, i18n keys, type definitions)
- [ ] `Hostel` and `Hotel` added under new `Hospitality` category
- [ ] Property types grouped into three categories: Residential / Commercial / Hospitality
- [ ] Required fields branch by category (Residential: bedrooms/bathrooms/area; Commercial: area + no bedrooms/bathrooms; Hospitality: rooms + bathrooms + amenities, no price)
- [ ] Hospitality listings appear under both Rent and Sell toggles, with price hidden in both
- [ ] Hospitality listings render in a separate section on Home / Favorites / OwnerListings (not mixed with residential/commercial)
- [ ] `PropertyDetailsScreen` renders hospitality listings without price, surfacing 3D tours and panoramic media

**Minimal-roles precursor (supports Hospitality URL gating in M1):**
- [ ] Hardcoded admin email allowlist gates Matterport URL + panoramic image URL edit fields (all other listing fields remain user-editable)

**Release:**
- [ ] Version bump to 1.0.4 (Android versionCode → 25, iOS CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION → 21)
- [ ] Manual verification on physical iOS + Android devices before submission

### Active — Milestone 2 (captured for roadmap visibility)

<!-- Milestone 2 — "Roles & Moderation". Separate future milestone/release. Captured here per user request so the roadmap shows both. -->

- [ ] Formal three-role system: `admin` / `moderator` / `user` (replaces M1 hardcoded email gate)
- [ ] Moderator can: approve listings, flag/remove content, edit any user's listing
- [ ] Admin can: all moderator actions + edit Matterport/panoramic URLs + set verification badges + promote-to-moderator + add new admins + full backend access
- [ ] Role-aware UI gating across CreateListing, PropertyDetails, and any other surfaces that expose restricted actions
- [ ] Admin-facing UIs for moderation queue and role promotion
- [ ] Backend changes to make `userType` trustworthy (custom claims, authenticated role source)

### Out of Scope

- **2GIS native map bridge** — Significant separate milestone; decision + plan captured in `2GIS_BRIDGE_PLAN.md`. Not required for v1.0.4 polish release.
- **Payment/booking for hospitality** — Hospitality listings are showcase-only by design. Hostels/hotels have daily dynamic pricing the platform cannot reliably track; contact details drive offline booking.
- **Per-night price type for hospitality** — Eliminated because the platform is showcase-only; price fields hidden entirely for Hostel/Hotel.
- **Chat moderation tooling** — M2 moderator scope covers listings only. Chat moderation is a later concern.
- **New authentication providers (OAuth, magic link, 2FA)** — Email/password with reset covers current user base.
- **In-app role promotion UI in M1** — Deferred to M2. M1 uses hardcoded email allowlist; admins are assigned via code edits until the M2 roles system ships.
- **Migration tooling for existing listings** — No production listings exist (confirmed); all current data is mock. Clean slate for the category/type changes.

## Context

**Project stage:** Pre-launch, brownfield. Current public version is 1.0.3 (Android versionCode 24, iOS build 20). No production listings; all content is mock data. Working toward v1.0.4 polish release to app stores.

**Target users:** Property listers (landlords, sellers, hostel/hotel operators) and prospective renters/buyers in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. EN/RU bilingual.

**Tech stack (from `.planning/codebase/STACK.md`):** React Native 0.84.0 (New Architecture enabled, Hermes on both platforms), React 19.2.3, TypeScript 5.8.3, Node 22+. Navigation is a custom boolean-state machine in `App.tsx` — no react-navigation. Cross-cutting state via nested Context providers (`ThemeProvider` → `LanguageProvider` → `AuthProvider`). HTTP via `axios` to a Railway-hosted backend plus direct Firebase Identity Toolkit REST calls.

**Known architecture concerns (from `.planning/codebase/CONCERNS.md` and `ARCHITECTURE.md`):**
- `App.tsx` navigation state machine holds 20+ boolean flags and conditional rendering — likely root cause of the bottom-nav unresponsiveness bug
- Tab persistence pattern keeps screens mounted via `display: none` ("keep-alive") — suspect for nav focus/touch-capture issues
- Service layer has partial admin gating via `user.backendProfile.userType === 'admin'` at exactly one call site (`PropertyDetailsScreen.tsx:178`)

**Prior artifacts:**
- `.planning/codebase/` — full codebase map (ARCHITECTURE, STACK, CONVENTIONS, STRUCTURE, INTEGRATIONS, CONCERNS, TESTING) generated 2026-04-22
- `2GIS_BRIDGE_PLAN.md` — decision + plan for future native 2GIS map bridge (out of scope for this milestone)

**Testing posture:** Manual verification on physical iOS and Android devices is the bar for M1. Added regression tests are welcome where feasible but not required to unblock the release.

## Constraints

- **Platform:** iOS + Android via React Native 0.84 (New Architecture). All M1 fixes must work on both. — Cross-platform parity is a core product promise; one-sided fixes create store-review friction.
- **Timeline:** Ship M1 to app stores ASAP. — User explicitly prioritized shipping over scope width; M2 (roles) was split out to protect this deadline.
- **Navigation:** No navigation library (custom `App.tsx` state machine). Fixes must work within this pattern; migrating to `react-navigation` is out of scope. — Rewriting navigation would be weeks of work and is unrelated to the polish goals.
- **Data:** Clean slate — no production listings. — Category/type schema changes (remove Land, add Hostel/Hotel) need no migration path; simplifies M1.
- **Auth:** Firebase Identity Toolkit + backend `userType` field. — M1 admin gate reuses the existing `userType` check via a hardcoded email allowlist; M2 will harden this into real roles.
- **i18n:** All new UI strings must be added to EN + RU locale tables (`src/locales/en.json`, `src/locales/ru.json`). — Bilingual Bishkek user base; Russian-only or English-only strings ship as bugs.
- **Theme:** New UI must respect existing `useTheme()` colors (dark + light). — Consistency with the rest of the app.

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Split roles into Milestone 2 | Full role system is material work; would delay the store-critical polish release | — Pending |
| Hardcoded admin email allowlist in M1 | Needed to gate Matterport/panoramic URL editing on Hospitality listings before M2 ships real roles; minimal implementation that doesn't block release | — Pending |
| Remove `Land` entirely | User decision — not part of the product's target use cases for Bishkek | — Pending |
| Hospitality (Hostel/Hotel) is showcase-only, no price | Daily dynamic pricing can't be reliably tracked; contact info drives offline booking | — Pending |
| Hospitality listings appear under both Rent and Sell (no price in either) | An owner renting out hostel rooms vs. selling the whole hostel are both valid listing intents | — Pending |
| Hospitality rendered in a separate section on list screens | Different information density (tours-first, no price) warrants visual separation | — Pending |
| Required-field sets branch by category, not individual type | 9 chips → 3 categories is easier to maintain and explain than per-chip conditionals | — Pending |
| Universal keyboard solution, library choice deferred to planner | User wants robustness over any specific library; research phase will pick (likely `react-native-keyboard-controller`, `KeyboardAvoidingView`, or similar) | — Pending |
| Bottom-nav fix starts with reproduction + root-cause, not a guess | Bug location is "unknown — need to investigate"; suspected in `App.tsx` boolean state machine | — Pending |
| 2GIS native map bridge excluded from this milestone | Separate multi-week effort; plan already drafted in `2GIS_BRIDGE_PLAN.md` | — Pending |
| Phase 1 pre-fix device-matrix baseline deferred (accepted risk, 2026-04-22) | User time-constrained; full 45-cell × 2-platform device matrix not feasible before Plan 03 code fix lands. Routes through RESEARCH §9 A6 / §10 Q2 zero-FAIL branch upfront. Plan 04 gate semantics change from "FAILs→0" to "no regression + primary trap sequence visibly fixed"; D-04 pause-and-reassess trigger likelihood is higher. | — Accepted |
